                    I am a passionate individual with a strong interest in coding, technology, and personal growth. With hands-on experience in C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I find immense satisfaction in solving problems and bringing innovative ideas to life through programming. Outside of my technical pursuits, I have a love for travel, football, and luxury automobiles, particularly brands like Ferrari and Mercedes, which inspire my appreciation for design and performance. I am an avid traveler, eager to explore new cultures and landscapes, while football brings excitement, teamwork, and discipline into my life.

                    In my free time, I enjoy a mix of hobbies that help me unwind and stay motivated. I love playing games, which challenge my strategic thinking and problem-solving skills, while watching movies allows me to immerse myself in creative storytelling. Music is a constant companion, offering relaxation and inspiration, and programming continues to be a hobby that fuels my curiosity and creativity. These diverse interests help me stay balanced, constantly learning, and inspired in both my personal and professional endeavors.
