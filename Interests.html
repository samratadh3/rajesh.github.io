                I have a deep passion for coding and technology, with hands-on experience in C, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Programming for me is not just about writing code, but about bringing innovative ideas to life and solving real-world problems. Beyond technology, I am an avid traveler who loves discovering new places, cultures, and meeting people from different walks of life. Traveling allows me to broaden my perspective and fuel my creativity. Football is another area that drives me, whether I’m playing the game, watching matches, or analyzing strategies. It teaches me teamwork, discipline, and the value of continuous improvement. My admiration for luxury automobiles, especially brands like Ferrari and Mercedes, reflects my appreciation for excellence, precision, and cutting-edge design. These varied interests—coding, football, travel, and cars—keep me constantly learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of what I can achieve both personally and professionally.

            <div>
                In my free time, I enjoy playing games, which not only offer entertainment but also enhance my problem-solving skills and creativity. Whether it’s strategic or action-packed, gaming helps me stay sharp and think on my feet. Watching movies is another passion of mine, as I find joy in exploring different genres and stories that inspire and entertain me. Music is an essential part of my life, and I love listening to a wide range of songs, which allows me to relax, reflect, and sometimes even spark new ideas. Lastly, programming remains one of my top hobbies, as it allows me to experiment, learn, and continuously improve my skills. It’s not just a career path for me but a creative outlet that lets me bring my ideas to life and challenge myself with new coding projects. These hobbies keep me balanced, inspired, and constantly learning in both my personal and professional life.
