                Creating my portfolio website involves several key milestones to ensure a well-structured and visually
                appealing platform. The process begins with planning and research, where I define my goals, identify the
                target audience, and outline the websiteâ€™s structure. This helps establish a clear vision and direction
                for the project.

            <div>

                Next, I focus on designing the layout by creating wireframes, selecting a color scheme, and choosing
                typography that aligns with my personal brand. Ensuring a clean, modern, and responsive design is a
                priority to enhance the user experience. Moving into development, I build the website using HTML, CSS,
                and JavaScript, implementing a responsive design with Flexbox or Grid to make it accessible across all
                devices.
            </div>
            <div>
                As I progress, I incorporate interactive elements such as animations, hover effects, and a functional
                contact form to make the website engaging. Once the core features are in place, I conduct thorough
                testing to check for cross-browser compatibility, optimize performance, and fix any UI inconsistencies.
            </div>
            <div>
                Finally, I deploy the website on GitHub Pages and ensure ongoing maintenance by updating projects and
                refining design elements to keep my portfolio up-to-date and effectively showcase my skills.
